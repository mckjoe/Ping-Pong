## What's it do?
_This app recieves a number from a user, and then runs a function on that number to create an array of numbers from 1 through the input number, and then goes through that array of numbers with another function, changing anything divisible evenly by 3 to the word "ping", anything divisible evenly by 5 to the word "pong", and anything divisible evenly by 15 to the word "pingpong" (breath) and will display it for the user in the html, each number or word as a list element._
